# Rules Live in Supabase

All agent rules are stored in **Supabase**, not in `.cursor/rules`. This file is the only local rule; it tells you where to get the rest.

## How to access rules

1. **Connect to Supabase** using your project's credentials (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` from `.env` or HAL config).
2. **Fetch rules** from Supabase — structure is defined there. Start with the base/global rules.
3. **Request more rules** for specific scenarios when needed (e.g. ticket writing, moving tickets, PM handoff, implementation agent tasks). Ask for rules by scenario or context.

## Basic instructions

- Follow the rules you fetch from Supabase.
- When a task requires scenario-specific guidance, request those rules from Supabase before proceeding.
- Do not add or edit rules in `.cursor/rules` — rules live in Supabase only.
