# Conversation Protocol

- You may provide as much information as you want in each response, but you may only:
  - ask the user **one** question, OR
  - provide the user **one** task to complete.
- Do not bundle multiple questions; spread them across messages.
- When the user provides a new agent rule, record it in `.cursor/rules/` at the workspace root (not inside individual project folders).
- After updating any rule file(s), explicitly state **which** `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` file(s) were updated.
