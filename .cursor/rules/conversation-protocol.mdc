# Conversation Protocol

- You may do as much work as needed per message.
- When you need user input, you may ask **at most one** question in that message.
- Do not bundle multiple questions; spread them across messages.
- When the user provides a new agent rule, record it in `.cursor/rules/` at the workspace root (not inside individual project folders).
- After updating any rule file(s), explicitly state **which** `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` file(s) were updated.
