# Submodule Sync Protocol

## This Repo is a Submodule

This repository (`portfolio-2026-basic-kanban`) is included as a submodule in `portfolio-2026-hal` at path `projects/kanban`.

## After Pushing Changes Here

When you push changes to this repo, you MUST also update the submodule pointer in HAL:

```bash
# After pushing to this repo, go to HAL and run:
cd portfolio-2026-hal
git submodule update --remote projects/kanban
git add projects/kanban
git commit -m "chore: update kanban submodule to latest"
git push
```

## Why This Matters

- HAL embeds the kanban board via iframe from `projects/kanban`
- Git submodules lock to a specific commit, they do NOT auto-follow HEAD
- If you don't update the submodule, HAL will use stale code
- Other developers cloning HAL will get outdated code

## Checklist After Push

- [ ] Changes pushed to `portfolio-2026-basic-kanban`
- [ ] Submodule updated in `portfolio-2026-hal`
- [ ] Submodule change committed and pushed in HAL
