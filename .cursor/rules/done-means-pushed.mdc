# “Done” Means Committed + Pushed (All Agents)

- If any agent believes a task/story is **done**, they must:
  - **commit** all relevant changes, and
  - **push** to the remote
  before telling the user or project manager that it’s done.
- Agents must not delegate commit/push work to the user/PM (e.g., “after you commit and push…”).
  - If commit/push hasn’t happened yet, the correct status is **“not ready for verification.”**
- “Done/ready” messages must include the exact `git status -sb` output showing the branch is synced and the working tree is clean.
  - “Clean” means: **no modified files** and **no untracked files** (ignored build artifacts are fine).

## Commit message linkage (no commit hashes in docs)

- Every commit that belongs to a ticket must include the ticket ID in the commit subject (e.g. `feat(0010): ...`, `fix(0008): ...`, `docs(0009): ...`).
- If `git status -sb` is not clean/synced, the agent must say **“not ready for verification”** and keep working until it is.
  - Do not claim “ready” if `git status` shows any `??` (untracked) or `M` (modified) entries.

## PM verification

- The project manager’s “done” is only **candidate-complete** until the user verifies the acceptance criteria.
- Do not use language like “done” or “complete” until changes are committed and pushed.
