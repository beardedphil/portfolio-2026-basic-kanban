# “Done” Means Committed + Pushed (All Agents)

- If any agent believes a task/story is **done**, they must:
  - **commit** all relevant changes, and
  - **push** to the remote
  before telling the user or project manager that it’s done.
- Agents must not delegate commit/push work to the user/PM (e.g., “after you commit and push…”).
  - If commit/push hasn’t happened yet, the correct status is **“not ready for verification.”**

## PM verification

- The project manager’s “done” is only **candidate-complete** until the user verifies the acceptance criteria.
- Do not use language like “done” or “complete” until changes are committed and pushed.
